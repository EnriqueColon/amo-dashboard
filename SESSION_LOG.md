## 2026-07-16 → 2026-07-20 — Warehouse/credit-facility feature: research → pipeline → production backfill → dashboard tab

**Status as of last message: production backfill is running (cron, on droplet), real results confirmed (~60 hits so far in a 6-month window). New "Credit Facilities" dashboard tab is built and verified locally but NOT YET DEPLOYED — deploy steps below.**

### The finding that drove everything
Literal "warehouse line of credit" wording essentially never appears in Miami-Dade recorded documents — real language varies every time ("Warehousing Loan and Security Agreement", a bare parenthetical "(Warehouse Agreement)", "Credit Agreement" + "as Agent for the Lenders", UCC "as Administrative Agent" chains). Keyword search reliably fails; only an LLM reading full document text catches it, and even then imperfectly (same exact facility phrased near-identically across two filings — one caught, one missed, in later testing). Confirmed via a real user-supplied example (`Collateral Assignment of Mortgage`, CFN `2024R432043`, BGI Financial LLC / City National Bank of Florida) → led to finding 13 related documents for that relationship, then a second (Bradesco Bank / Eastern Financial Mortgage Corp).

### Pilot → validated prompt
189-document pilot (`collector/research/scripts/extract_facility_pilot_v3.py`, gitignored/local-only) landed on a prompt scoring 10/13 known-positives, 0/6 known-negatives, 0/135 false positives on a random baseline. Repeated-grantor/grantee-pair heuristic alone has poor precision (1 real hit / 7 tested) — not used as a gate in the real pipeline. LLM cost is trivial (~$0.00024/doc measured), so the real pipeline scans every document rather than pre-filtering.

### Pipeline integration (`extract_pdfs.py`, `batch_extract_facility.py`, `normalize.py`)
- **Critical lesson (re-learn before touching this again):** merging facility detection into the existing `doc_category` LLM call broke detection completely (0/13, was 10/13 standalone) — root cause was dropping the `has_facility_language` boolean field and renaming JSON keys, an untested deviation from the validated prompt. **Facility detection is a second, fully separate LLM call** (`llm_extract_facility()` / `FACILITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `extract_pdfs.py`), using the *exact* verbatim pilot prompt/field names — renaming into `facility_*`-prefixed DB columns happens only in `postprocess_facility()`, in code. **Do not edit `FACILITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` or merge the two calls without re-running `collector/research/scripts/verify_integration.py` against the 21 known-labeled CFNs first (must score 21/21).**
- `pdf_extractions` gained 10 `facility_*` columns. `save_facility()` does a partial UPDATE so the batch path never clobbers doc_category/etc.
- `normalize.py` builds `credit_facility_events` (separate table, independent of `aom_events_clean`'s loan-transfer-only filter — confirmed zero impact on that filter). **Schema: `cfn, rec_date, doc_type, grantor, grantee, rec_book, rec_page, facility_type, facility_agreement_name, facility_agreement_date, facility_lender_name, facility_agent_name, facility_borrower_name, facility_amount, facility_amount_type, facility_evidence_quote, facility_confidence`** — note `rec_book`/`rec_page` were missing in the first version and had to be added (see "dashboard tab" section below).
- `batch_extract_facility.py` — bulk backfill via OpenAI's Batch API. Has manual 4-stage CLI (`--build`/`--submit`/`--poll`/`--ingest`) and automatic **`--tick`** mode (cron-driven): polls in-flight jobs, ingests finished ones, tops back up to `--max-concurrent` by submitting new chunks (newest `rec_date` first). State in `batch_jobs` + `batch_job_documents` tables (the latter exists to stop an in-flight chunk's CFNs from being re-selected into a second chunk before the first is ingested — was a real bug, same 5 CFNs got submitted 3x before the fix). Lock file prevents overlapping cron runs; stale `building` jobs >1h auto-fail so their CFNs free up.
- **Production droplet is a 1-vCPU/1GB box** — the original `DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=8` caused massive CPU contention (tesseract timeouts, ~8% failure rate) in the first real cron run. Fixed: worker count now derives from `os.cpu_count()` (capped at 4, override via `--workers`/`DOWNLOAD_WORKERS` env), chunk size reduced 3000→500, OCR subprocess timeout 120s→180s. **If this ever moves to a bigger box, these defaults can go back up.**
- **`--since YYYY-MM-DD` flag** added to scope a backfill to a recent date range (e.g. for a deadline) without touching any data/state — just filters which documents count as "pending." Currently **`run_facility_tick.sh` passes `--since 2026-01-16`** (~6 months back) because of a presentation deadline. **To resume full history, just delete that flag from `collector/run_facility_tick.sh`, commit, push, `git pull` on the droplet — no other state needs to change.**

### Production state (confirmed via droplet SSH by user)
- Cron entry live: `*/20 * * * * /opt/amo-dashboard/collector/run_facility_tick.sh >> /opt/amo-dashboard/collector/batch/tick.log 2>&1`
- As of last check: 6-month backlog was ~9,300 documents, all but 2 processed (batches of ~500 running every few hours via the Batch API, ~200+ docs/hour observed real throughput).
- **~60 confirmed real hits found.** Notable recurring institutional relationships (same facility, multiple filings as loans get pledged/released):
  - City National Bank of Florida ↔ Vaster Loans III, LLC — $102.5M, 7 filings
  - Amerant Bank ↔ Atlantis Holdings AM LLC — $15M, 3 filings
  - Banesco USA ↔ Winston Ban, LLC — $20M, 3 filings
  - INTER US FINANCE, LLC ↔ BGT Real Estate Opportunity Fund Ltd. — $1.98M, 3 filings
  - Bradesco Bank ↔ Jared Larsen/JLCFI (the original hand-found 2016 facility) — 3 filings
  - Plus large one-offs: JPMorgan + 6-bank syndicate on an ESA hotel portfolio ($1.935B), Bank Hapoalim → S3 RE North Bay ($200M), WSFB Lender II → Parakeet Property Owner II ($183.8M).
  - ~9 of the 60 are Amerant Bank **consumer HELOCs** (individual homeowners) — real "revolving line of credit" language but not institutional, kept distinguishable via `facility_type = consumer_or_business_line_of_credit`.
- "Facility Size" caveat: when a facility recurs across filings, don't sum `facility_amount` per row (it's the same facility cited repeatedly, not separate loans) — the dashboard's total-volume stat already dedupes on `(lender, borrower, amount)`.

### New: "Credit Facilities" dashboard tab (built + verified locally, NOT deployed)
`client/src/pages/CreditFacilities.tsx` (new) + `GET /api/credit-facility-events` and `GET /api/credit-facility-events/chart?type=monthly|top_lenders|by_facility_type|total_volume` (new, in `server/routes.ts`, mirroring `/api/clean-events` and `/api/reporting/chart` patterns) + nav wiring in `App.tsx`/`Sidebar.tsx`. Shows summary stats, a monthly filing-activity chart, top-lenders ranking, and a filterable/paginated table with click-to-expand evidence quotes and county-portal links.

**Three real bugs found and fixed while verifying in-browser** (local dev server, `.claude/launch.json` created at the *parent* dir `/Users/enrique/Downloads/amo-dashboard-source/.claude/launch.json`, not inside `amo-dashboard/` — the preview tool looks for it at cwd, which is the parent):
1. `credit_facility_events` never had `rec_book`/`rec_page` (needed for the county-portal link) — added to both `normalize.py`'s schema/INSERT and `server/db.ts`'s defensive `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.
2. Top-lenders grouping was case-sensitive, splitting the same real lender into duplicate rows ("City National Bank of Florida" vs the all-caps OCR'd form) — now groups on `UPPER(facility_lender_name)`.
3. Row-expand (evidence quote) silently did nothing — a shorthand `<>...</>` fragment was used as the `.map()` return value, which can't carry a `key` prop, breaking React's reconciliation. Fixed with `<Fragment key={r.cfn}>`.

Also learned: `tsx server/index.ts` (this project's dev command) does **not** hot-reload server-side TS changes — must fully stop/restart the preview server after editing `server/*.ts`, unlike client `.tsx` changes which Vite HMRs automatically.

**Not yet deployed** — needs, on the droplet: `git pull`, `npm run build`, restart Node, **and re-run `normalize.py` once** so `credit_facility_events` picks up the new `rec_book`/`rec_page` columns (`cd collector && source /opt/amo-dashboard/.env && .venv/bin/python3 normalize.py`). Local dev DB only had 11 rows when the tab was tested (lags production, as usual) — production will show the full ~60+ and growing.

### Next steps for a future session
1. Deploy the dashboard tab (steps above).
2. Keep letting the cron backfill run; consider widening/removing `--since` in `run_facility_tick.sh` once the presentation deadline has passed, to backfill full history (~51,700 docs total, was estimated ~4-8 days at observed throughput before scoping to 6 months).
3. `normalize.py` isn't on a cron itself — needs periodic manual re-runs (or a second, less-frequent cron entry) to keep `credit_facility_events` fresh with newly-ingested batches.
4. Two rows worth a manual sanity check (flagged, not yet resolved): `2026R268269` (JPMorgan/KB7 Holdings — evidence quote reads like a routine SBA note renewal, possibly a false positive) and `2026R277453` (grantor extracted as literal string "Lender", likely an OCR gap).
5. Known lingering repo-hygiene item, deliberately not touched (risk to live production DB): `miami_dade_amo.db-shm`/`-wal` are tracked in git from before `*.db-shm`/`*.db-wal` were added to `.gitignore` — untracking them (`git rm --cached`) should be done deliberately/separately, not blindly, since it interacts with `git pull` against the live production database file.
